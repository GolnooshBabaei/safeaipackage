# SAFE AI

To fulfill trustworthiness, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods need to be safe. SAFE referes to the four ethics in AI: robu_S_tness, 
_A_ccuracy, _F_airness, and _E_xplainability. In other words, a safe application of AI must satisfy four basic key-principles, summarised as: 
robustness, accuracy, fairness and  explainability.
